        Hello and thank you for visiting my "about me" page. My background is in oil and gas engineering. I decided to start learning web development with the intent of transitioning into a career in tech. The ultimate goal is to become a full-stack web developer, fluent in multiple languages.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutmesummary">
        Why change careers? Development is more gratifying. Learning to code has seemed more of an engineering problem than oil and gas work itself. Getting to solve puzzles and design layouts, watching your project grow over time, and when you're done the solution is scalable. New technologies are always around the corner and there are always skills to refine or add to the developer toolbelt. There may be no better job for a self-proclaimed life long learner.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutmesummary">
        I am fascinated by the various technologies we see emerging. Music synthesis, virtual/augmented reality and automation are just a few of the subjects that spark the imagination. The idea that in ten years I may be working from home, watering plants from my phone in a different city, and having groceries delivered by a self-driving car; Okay maybe the last one is too hopeful. Either way, I would like to play a small part in the advancement of tech.
       </p>
       <p class="aboutmesummary">
        Please have a look at some of my projects and feel free to contact me with critiques, recommendations or if you think I may be a good match for a position you are looking to fill.
