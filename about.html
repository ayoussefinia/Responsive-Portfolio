        <!-- Greetings, thank you for visiting my page. My background is in oil and gas engineering. I graduated from University of Texas at Austin, not far from my home city San Antonio. After a few years working in some of of the more interesting places on the planet (North Dakota, Saudi Arabia, Western Pennsylvannia, West Texas) I decided it was time for a change in careers. 

        I was drawn to Web Development because of its combining of technical and creative aspects. Feel freez -->
        Greetings! thank you for visiting my page. I have a wide background in work, mostly oil and gas related with some service industry and transportation. I graduated with a degree in Petroleum Engineering from UT Austin before working various oil fields around the U.S. and globally. While this field sent me some interesting places and taught me a bunch about hands-on problem solving, I found that civilization was always calling. My preference was to be closer to family and work in something that better fits my personality.

        <p class="aboutmesummary">
        Web development always seemed like the cool job but not knowing anything about it was pretty intimidating. I knew from previous experience that I liked solving puzzles and bringing abstract thoughts into reality which might help with learning code. This pushed me to take my first online class about two years ago. After a few more, I decided it was worth devoting full attention. Now that I've done a handful of courses and a coding boot-camp, I'm looking to get my foot in the door with an entry level position.
        </p>
    <p class="aboutmesummary">
        Outside of work I am a runner, reader, music hobbyist, and a self proclaimed life long learner. I'm fascinated by tech's ever changing impact on every day life. Ideally, I would like to devote some of that curiosity and fascination toward developing awesome applications that help transfer some of our daily burdens to computers. Thanks for reading -Alex -->
