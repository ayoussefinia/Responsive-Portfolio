        Greetings! thank you for visiting my page. I have a wide background in work, mostly oil and gas related with some service industry and transportation. I graduated with a degree in Petroleum Engineering from UT Austin before working various oil fields around the U.S. and globally. While this field sent me some interesting places and taught me a bunch about hands-on problem solving, I found that civilization was always calling. My preference was to be closer to family and work in something that better fits my personality.

        Web development always seemed like the cool job but not knowing anything about it was pretty intimidating. I knew from previous experience that I liked solving puzzles and bringing abstract thoughts into reality which might help with learning code. This pushed me to take my first online class about two years ago. After a few more, I decided it was worth devoting full attention. Now that I've done a handful of courses and a coding boot-camp, I'm looking to get my foot in the door with an entry level position.

    <p class="aboutmesummary">
        Outside of work I am a runner, reader, music hobbyist, and a self proclaimed life long learner. I'm fascinated by tech's ever changing impact on every day life. Ideally, I would like to devote some of that curiosity and fascination toward developing awesome applications that help transfer some of our daily burdens to computers. Thanks for reading -Alex
