        Hello and thank you for visiting my page. I have a wide background in work, mostly oil and gas related with some service industry and transportation. I graduated with a degree in Petroleum Engineering back in 2010, when my ambition was to make lots of money without having to go to grad school. A few years in the oil fields had me thinking I would be best suited to choose something in civilization for a long term career, something that better fits my personality.

          The idea to learn web development came from a hunch that was based off my love of computers and fascination with tech. The more I learn the more I feel that hunch was justified. It's been exiting in many ways. There's always something new to learn. Getting to watch a project develop over time, solving puzzles and seeing how your puzzle piece fits into the bigger picture keeps the mind occupied and the day interesting.

      Now that I've done a handful of online courses and a coding boot-camp, I'm looking to get my foot in the door with an entry level position. If you've made it this far please have a look at some of my projects and feel free to contact me with critiques, recommendations or if you think I may be a good match for a position you are looking to fill. Thanks -Alex
